Project: Todo app with statuses (to do, doing, done)

Todo schema: {
    id: ID,
    content: {
        title: String,
        description: String
    },
    status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done',
    createdAt: DateTime,
    updatedAt: DateTime,
    priority: 'low' | 'regular' | 'high'
}

Layout:
1. Create 3 cols for todos with statuses (to do, doing, done) (R)
2. Create form for adding todos (with "+ or Add" button) (C)
3. Create template of todo card with info and (action button (start | finish | delete))* (U and D)

Logic (flow steps):
    Cols:
        1. Create html markup for 3 cols with diff ids (todo-list, doing-list, done-list)
        2. Find them via .getElementById(id) and save to vars (const)
        3. Get an array with todos (for start we need to create the mock data with todos)
        4. Create func for render items in cols (separate for statuses)
        5. Render
    Add form:
        -create form with id in HTML;
        -add input fields: title, description;
        -add select field for priority;
        -add button to the form with type "submit": create ToDo;
        -find this form by id;
        -create a function, which will create new ToDo ac—Åording to our scheme;
        -render;
    Todo card actions:
        -add buttons to each ToDo depending on the status! (Todo-List - Start, doing-list - finish, done-list -delete)
        -create a function with event "click", which will change their status and afterwards delete from one colomn and add to another;  
        -render;
